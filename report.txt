BHT Classical Computing 

intro
BHT is a conventional Computing algorithm for locating collisons in hash functions . the algorithm works by iteratively creating random hash function inputs and determining whether any of them yield the same output.

Use Cases

1. Detecting collisions in crytopgraphic hash functions in securing communications, digital signatures.
2. Computer security=> the algorithm can be used to detect vulnarabilities in the computer systems.

Insights/Observations

1. The number of input bits n and the number of iterations k have a big impact on the performance of the algorithm. the algorithm becomes more computationally intensive as these values increases and the possibility of collision detection increases as well.

2.The algorithm can be improved through the use of more efficient search algorithms such as binary search tree or hash tables.
